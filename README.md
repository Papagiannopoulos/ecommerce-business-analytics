# E-commerce Sales Transactions Analysis
This is a sales transaction public available dataset of UK-based e-commerce (online retail) for one year.  
This shop has been selling gifts and homewares for adults and children through the website since 2007.

## Project Summary
This project analyzes a random year of UK e-commerce transactions to uncover:   
1) Customer behavior ‚û°Ô∏è customer segmentation based on Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM)  
2) Product trends ‚û°Ô∏è market basket analysis  
3) Opportunities for business growth ‚û°Ô∏è cohort analysis  
This analysis reveal key drivers of revenue, retention, and product associations.

## üîç Dataset
I used the Kaggle API (Program > kaggle_data_download.py) to automatically load the dataset.  
Navigate to the [ Reproducibility](#-reproducibility) for more details regarding Kaggle API.

## üßπ Data Preprocessing
1. **Data Cleaning**: Filtered cancelled transactions (~1.6%), removed duplicates (<1%), handled missing values  
2. **Feature Engineering**: Created revenue calculations (+ log-transformed), date components and metrics for visualisations  
3. **Create Categories**: Created categories using regex patterns 

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Key insights
- **Recorded period**: 2018-12-01 to 2019-11-30 (Removed 2019-12 because the dataset did not contain the whole month)
- **Total Revenue**: ¬£60,269,235
- **Total Customers**: 4,671
- **Geographic Concentration**: UK represents 83% of total revenue
- **Seasonal Patterns**: September/October/November show peak revenue performances
- **Customer Behavior**: Friday/Sunday emerge as the highest revenue days
- **Transaction Volume**: Average of 278 items per transaction indicates bulk purchasing
- **Most Customers buy bulk** (70.6% of customers buy more than 100 products per order on average)

### Bulk vs Retail Customers
- **Retail Customers** : 1373 (AVG Quantity Per Transaction <= 100)
- **Bulk Customers** : 3298 (AVG Quantity Per Transaction > 100)

## üë• Customer Segmentation

### RFM Analysis
Customers were segmented using RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) with each variable devided into 5 equal size parts to identify distinct behavioral groups:

- **VIP Customers**: High-value, frequent, recent purchasers ‚û°Ô∏è Those who belonged to the top parts (4th and 5th)
- **Loyal Customers**: Consistent engagement and spending
- **At Risk**: Previously valuable customers showing declining activity
- **New Customers**: Recent acquisitions

### Customer Distribution by Segement
![Customer Segment Distribution](images/rfn_segment_distribution.png)

- **Pareto Principle**: VIP customers alone (20%) generates ~61% of total revenue
- **Top 3 segments** generate 80.7% of total revenue

## üß© Customer Retention Analysis 

### Cohort Analysis
**Cohort analysis groups customers by the month they first made a purchase and tracks how many return in later months.**  
**This helps measure monthly customer retention and spot seasonal patterns**
![Cohort](images/cohort.png)

#### Retention Insights
**We don't include the first month in our cohort analysis because our dataset only covers one full year.**
**Including the first month would give incomplete retention results, since we can't track earlier activity or repeat purchases from before the dataset starts.**

**First Month Dropoff:**
   - Average first-month retention: 20.3%  

### Average Retention Rate per Month
![Cohort](images/seasonal_retention_rate.png)

**Top 3 months for retention :**  
   - September: 24.1%
   - October: 23.3%
   - April: 20.6%

**Bottom 3 months for retention :**  
   - March: 14.1%
   - June: 17.5%
   - July: 14.7%

### Insights
- **We can recognize a big dropoff on the first month (79.7%) which probably correlates to the fact that most customers buy bulk.**
- **We can see a clear seasonal pattern of customer retention:**
    - Summer months seem to be the worst for retention due to the holiday season (June, July).
    - Retention increases from September, likely with the start of the academic year. 

## üõí Market Basket Analysis
**Market basket analysis looks at customer purchase data to find out which products are often bought together.**

### Key metrics
- **Support:**  measures how common is the pairing of products A and B
- **Confidence:** measures how likely is product B bought when product A is bought
- **Lift:** measures how much does product A boost the chances of product B being bought compared to random

**Highlights**
- **Transactions with at lest two items:** 17527 | 92.4% of total transactions
- **Average basket size**: 26.2 items

**Top 5 Product Associations (by Lift):**
1) Herb Marker Thyme ‚Üí Herb Marker Rosemary | Lift: 71.19 | Conf: 93.4%
2) Herb Marker Rosemary ‚Üí Herb Marker Thyme | Lift: 71.19 | Conf: 93.0%
3) Herb Marker Chives ‚Üí Herb Marker Parsley | Lift: 71.07 | Conf: 92.4%
